    <pre class="txt1">
Charity Lanes is an organization designed
to help those in need while also serving as
a recreational facility for the community. 
Our mission is to serve those who do not 
have access to basic needs. For example,
this summer we are raising money to put 
shoes on the feet of barefooted children. 
Shoes are a basic necessity in life as 
there are so many dangers to our feet that
could cause long term health problems. We
will first start with children because 
their feet are among the most vulnerable.
Our next step will be helping the elderly
and then other adults.

    <pre class="txt2">
In order to help as many people as possible, we are going to change
the group we are helping each season. So we will start with
barefooted children this summer, barefooted elderly and adults
in the fall and so on. Our organization will help more than just 
the barefooted members of society but that is where we will start
for now. Our donations will not just be limited to our local
community, the more money we raise, the farther our helping hands
can stretch.

    <span class="money">Donations</span>
    <pre class="txt3">
We are not asking anyone to donate money. We are simply donating
our own profits made from people bowling and having fun. When
you are charged for renting bowling shoes, the money from that
purchase is donated. The money we make from dessert items also 
gets donated.
